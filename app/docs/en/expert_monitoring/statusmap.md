## What is the statusmap?

The [statusmap] visualizes your hosts,
with their connection with each other
and their states.
This has many advantages,
at a glance your can find
which host connects with whom,
and who has an abnormal state.

## How can I use the statusmap?

If you want to see
if everything is fine
you just look on the color of each host point.

If you want to see
which host connects with whom,
you just have to take a look.

To show the name of the host you just have to hover over the host point.

If you click on a host point,
a few things will happen:
1. The map will zoom on that particular host point.
2. A window will appear on the right side with more information about that host.
3. Visible are the host, its children  and its parents only.
To disable this detail view click anywhere else on the map.

You can also search for a host to directly zoom to your needed host.
