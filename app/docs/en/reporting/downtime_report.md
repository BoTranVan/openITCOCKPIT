## What are downtime report?

[Downtime reports] generate reports in different formats of
hosts or hosts and their services
in a defined time span in which
downtimes occurred.

## How do I create an downtime report?

First choose what you want to **evaluate**, hosts or hosts with services.

Now choose the **report format** your options are HTML or PDF.

**HTML** will redirect you to the created web page.

**PDF** will create a PDF-document which you can download.

Choose the **timeperiod** and the time span in which your report is valid.

Now choose your **reflection sate**. You can choose between hard states only or soft and hard states.

The creation will only succeed if in the given timespan at least one downtime has occurred.
