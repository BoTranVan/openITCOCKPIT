## How does it work?

First of all you need a development machine. We recommand you to use [our development Vagrant box](https://github.com/it-novum/vagrantboxes/tree/master/openITCOCKPIT_V3-dev).

This box contains everything you need to start developing.

In the next step you need to create a fork of our repository.

If you are done or like to show your code to other people from the community, you are welcomed to create a pull request.
