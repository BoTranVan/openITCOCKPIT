## What can I do with the graph generator?

You can generate graphs with data from diffrent services.

## How do I generate a new graph?

To generate a [new graph][generator] you have to specify a timespan in which to draw a graph for a service in the coordinate system.

The following timespans are available:

* Last 30 Minutes
* Last 1 Hour
* Last 3 Hours
* Last 6 Hours
* Last 12 Hours
* Last 24 Hours
* Last 3 Days
* Last 7 Days
* Last 14 Days
* Last 30 Days

To check services into your graph you choose a host and then the service you want.
Then under service rules your chosen service appears.
Each service under service rules has one or more switches that you can check on
if you want to display them in your graph.

You can do the steps above several times to complete your graph as you like.

To see how it looks you can click on
<a class="btn btn-success btn-xs"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh"></span> Refresh graph</a>
or wait a few seconds to let the graph refresh itself.

If you are absolutely not happy with what you have done you can click on
<a class="btn btn-danger btn-xs"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span> Reset graph</a>
then the page looks like after a reload,
except that your chosen name and timespan remain there.

If you have completed your graph,
you can save your configuration under a reasonable name by clicking on
<a class="btn btn-default btn-primary btn-xs"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-save"></span> Save Configuration</a>.

## How can I move around in the graph? <span id="move-around"></span>

You to move in a direction you just drag the coordinate system in the opposite direction that you want to see.

Double-click the graph to zoom in.

Right-click the graph to zoom out.

To see the value of a specific point in your graph you just hover over it to see details.

## Where can I view my graphs?

To go to the listing of your saved graphs click on the [list tab][overview].
Here you find all your saved graphs and their configuration.

To edit or view a graph just click on its name.

To delete a graph check the box on the left, scroll down and hit delete.
