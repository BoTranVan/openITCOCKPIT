The calendar also has a bunch of option which you can use.

###### Calendar table

First I will introduce you to the calendar table.
The calendar table displays the current month if you open or create a new calendar.
Grayed out days are days that are not in the current month.
Each day can only hold one event. Each Event goes one whole day.

In the upper right of a day field in the calendar following buttons can appear:

* <a title="add" class="btn btn-xs btn-default"><i class="fa fa-plus-circle txt-color-green"></i></a>
	to create a new event on this day
* <a title="edit" class="btn btn-xs btn-default"><i class="fa fa-pencil txt-color-blue"></i></a>
	to edit the event on this day
* <a title="delete" class="btn btn-xs btn-default"><i class="fa fa-trash txt-color-red"></i></a>
	to delete the event on this day

You can also drag an event to another day without an event.

To change the month you work on click on
the left arrow button
to go to the previous month or click on
the right arrow button
to go to the next month.

###### Holiday sets

You want to add holidays?
We have defined default German and Austrian holidays for you.

Just click on
<a class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Holidays <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></a>
then a drop down menu will open where you can choose the following:
