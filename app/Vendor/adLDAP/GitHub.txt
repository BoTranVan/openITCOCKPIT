Issue Network timeout: https://github.com/adldap/adLDAP/issues/56
Hi,
i had the problem, that php kill my process after 30 seconds if the LDAP server was not reachable. I fixed this issue with the folowin line:
ldap_set_option($this->ldapConnection, LDAP_OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT, 25);
in lib/adLDAP/adLDAP.php's connect() function.

May be you can implement this to your class :)

Regards,
Daniel
